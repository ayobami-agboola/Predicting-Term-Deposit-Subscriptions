The prediction of term deposit subscriptions is critical task in the banking sector, enabling targeted marketing and improving resource allocation. In this study, a publicly available bank marketing dataset was analysed to develop four machine learning predictive models, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and a stacked ensemble combining random forest and logistic regression. Each model was evaluated both with and without hyperparameter optimization, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The results indicate that random forest and the stacked ensemble models outperformed logistic regression and SVM, achieving the highest ROC-AUC scores of 0.91. Random forest demonstrated superior accuracy (90%) and precision (81%), while the stacked ensemble model show a robust balance between precision (69%) and recall (82%). Logistic regression and SVM also excelled in recall, emphasizing their utility for minimizing false negatives. Feature importance analysis for all the models revealed "duration," as a critical predictor, "previous contact outcome", “balance”, “job type”, etc were also identified as predictors, which emphasized the need for feature-specific optimization in future campaigns. This research highlights the efficacy of ensemble methods and the critical role of feature engineering in addressing imbalanced classification challenges in the banking domain.
